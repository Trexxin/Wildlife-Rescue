# Wildlife-Rescue
Wildlife Rescues is a website created for my web development class that is modeled
after a wildlife rescue organization. The project was designed to be fully responsive
for all view ports.
This project familiarized me with responsive design concepts and the HTML/CSS
markup languages.
